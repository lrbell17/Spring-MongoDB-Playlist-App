# Spring-MongoDB-Playlist-App

A Simple Spring Boot REST application for accessing and manipulating song data in a personal playlist from your local MongoDB instance with a React.js user interface.  
The backend Spring Boot application version simply adds some initial records into the database and takes in user input from the url with options to add, delete and filter (by title, artist, or genre)

**Update:** most recently, added a user interface with React.js that implements features for fetching all records in the collection and deleting records based on user input

**To-Do:** continue implementing features in the front-end React app, such as adding a new record or filtering based on genre, artist, etc.
