# Spring-MongoDB-Playlist-App

A Simple Spring Boot REST application for accessing and manipulating song data in a personal playlist from your local MongoDB instance.  
The current version simply adds some initial records into the database and takes in user input from the url with options to add, delete and filter (by title, artist, or genre)
songs in the playlist. However, I plan on adding a more interactive UI with React.js
